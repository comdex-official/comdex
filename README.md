</div>

Comdex is an ecosystem of solutions built to bridge the gap between DeFi & CeFi by creating synthetic representations of real-world assets.

Investors holding a range of crypto assets can, on Comdex, collateralise and leverage their holdings to take exposure to synthetic assets. Users can lock-up their crypto holding in vaults and mint cAssets (synthetic assets on Comdex) which can be traded on a native exchange with other holders of cAssets.

This mechanism essentially enables holders of crypto assets to take simultaneous “long” positions on their holdings and on other cAssets.

## Docs
